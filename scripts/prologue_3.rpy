        The cars passed by just like how time did for me. It was a cloudy
        morning.
    """

    narrator """
        Every single weekday, a normal student goes to school and studies for
        their own sake. They were the words of every single teacher I've met.
        It's been six months since I left Track and Field. I used to be an
        athlete. They called me their ace until my legs got injured in an
        accident. It was an unfortunate incident that restricted the limits of
        my movements.
    """

    narrator """
        Afterwards, everyone treated me like an alien. My classmates once asked
        me about Alice. I told them that I didn't know, and after that, everyone
        treated me coldly. Same with my clubmates. I knew that they were being
        polite even if they were being passively annoyed by my indifference
        towards the situation of my missing close friend.
    """

    narrator """
        Not that their opinion is my problem. So what do you all want me to do,
        huh?
    """

    narrator """
       Anyway, one of my former clubmates at Track and Field randomly saw me
       smoking cigarettes in the streets. He lashed out at me as a result, which
       created some unnecessary scenes. I'm not even sure what his name was, nor
       have I had any recollection of talking with him before this childish
       dispute happened. All I got from the heated conversation (purely him), if
       you can call it one, was that he admired my skills and all that. 
    """

    narrator """
        It ended up with me punching his face and throwing a half-used cigarette
        away somewhere else in the streets.

    narrator """
        Needless to say, all of the students in school were scared of me the
        next day. I don't blame them. 
    """

    narrator """
        I remember the times of my stay in the hospital. I secretly kept blaming
        myself. My memories, anxiety, and the helpless hurt that was stuck right
        inside my chest. I don't know why they were there but they never
        disappeared. No matter how much time had passed.

        With a menthol cigarette, I inhaled the sweet cold nicotine inside my
        lungs and blew all the smoke away.

    narrator """
       \"Indifference huh? Not wrong but why should I bother explaining how I
       feel to everyone? As if their spoiled-ass life could ever sympathize with
       me. There's just no way.\"

    narrator "I shrugged at the afternoon sky and then let out a lazy yawn."

    narrator """
       I'm a student and I have a responsibility to graduate and work afterwards
       but why should I study? I don't even care. My grades could get all the
       red marks it deserved, and it wouldn't make me sad. Why am I even here at
       school? Why am i even trying?

    narrator """
        Months have already passed and here I am still asking the same
        questions.
    """

    narrator """
       I hated adults; to accept that there's already a path made for us was
       insane. But I do admit that the other way around was barbaric; I would
       rather have a system to follow. I guess it's embedded in my lifestyle as
       someone with connections to strange people.
    """

    narrator """
       Lately, however, it feels like nothing matters. No matter how much effort
       I exerted, it felt like there was no hint of progress. All the doubt and
       regret cluttered, and every single day it was ready to burst. Which is
       why I can't forgive myself. I hate my incompetence and detest every bit
       of myself. 
    """

    narrator """
       I guess this is what it would feel like if the world itself were against
       me. The dislike my heart instilled because of loneliness had never left
       completely. It's unfair. All I could do was place a poker face. Nothing
       of the bitter emotions I nurtured within me was ever expressed, thanks to
       my stubbornness. It's impossible. I could never erase the memories that
       bloomed. It haunted me. But whatever, I hate sad shit like that. That's
       why, even if it's embarassing, I must confess this wishy-washy thought
       unbecoming of a man: that someday, there may be a time where everything I
       had reflected on and experienced never turned into something useless or
       pale...

    narrator """
       Just like the cigarette atop my fingertips, I inhale it every time I'm
       sad and then throw it away after every leaf is completely burned out.
