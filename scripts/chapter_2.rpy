        That was Eve, our section's class president. Her stern demeanor made it
        hard for others to befriend her. The sharp edge of her words, feared by
        the strictest professors and students alike, had some sort of poison
        that destroyed anyone's morals. She was popular enough to politically
        dominate the current student council line-up; although this is probably
        an exaggeration, the fact that a hearsay like that had spread tells me
        enough.

    narrator """
        As a normal student, I'm not fully familiar with how the system of
        student council operates. But apparently, there was this system where
        the manner of power imitated governors. There could only be one student
        president per city, and every year, a student must vote.

    narrator """
        Anyway, I remember seniors trying to convince Eve and Alice to run
        because they have a certain image in public. They were two geniuses who
        were rivals in academics, but in the end, none of them ran as a
        candidate for any position. As a result, the battle was not even close.
        A girl I never heard of and an artist hailed as a prodigy, the daughter
        of a politician who was from Snowless Academy, had taken both the
        positions of president and vice president.

        What am i even doing in an academy that has a prestigious history? I
        suppose that I passed the entrance exam, but mind you, my aunt gave me
        some sort of spartan training to prepare for it. I'm not some sort of
        guy with a hidden genius or anything close. Aunt Emilia was just that
        good of a professor. In fact, all the professors here pale in
        comparison. In the end, I got accepted, and just like that, I'm now
        surrounded by people I had nothing in common with.

        Normally, my classmates would find this kind of scenario funny, but none

        I don't mind though. It's just as I expected. I've already thought of
        what's going to happen the moment I attend the class. Something like

        interrogating â€” I did find myself at the lower end of society all so

        The class that was once filled with silence, all of them suddenly
