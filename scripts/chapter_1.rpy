       I thought of attending class after my break. Every night, I work
       part-time at a coffee shop. I lied in my resume about how old I am, but
       as a barista, I'm apparently skilled enough. It was thanks to my aunt,
       who was a coffee nerd. She taught me a lot of priceless lessons in life.

       In a clubroom, the room was the same as ever. The reader's club was the
       club I ended up with after I quit the last one I joined. There were only
       a few of us. In fact, the members only met its minimum requirement. I,
       Eve, and the other man whose name I can't recall — he barely attended our
       club activities — can't blame me for that, honestly.

       it was certainly an experience. It was a fun read and well worth my time.

       curious why, and although I have my own reasons, I would rather keep it

       never demanding or bossy despite the fact, but her moral standards were
