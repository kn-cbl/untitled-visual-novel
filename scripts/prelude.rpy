        I ran for half an hour straight like my life was at stake. My mind was
        hazy, filled with rash conclusions that I didn't want to happen. It was
        as if my heart were about to burst. Thoughts that pained me. Words that
        killed her. The anxiety that I stored became a venom that pushed me. I
        didn't want her to die. I mean, it's not her fault. Surely, it was just
        a mistake. That time, I couldn't tell. Before I knew it, I was in front
        of Alice's house. I'm not even sure if I was late or not, or if there's
        a chance that I could change anything. That time, I only did what I
        should. Whether they were right or wrong, it's not for me to decide.
