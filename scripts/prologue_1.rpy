        I squinted at the rays of light. Just the sight of them blinded me as
        they passed through my eyes as soon as I woke up.

    narrator """
        Beside me, there were people in white clothes. A tall middle-aged man
        with a stoic face and a young woman who carried a black paper list close
        to her chest â€” both of them were obvious figures of a certain
        institution.

    narrator """
        I figured out that I was in a hospital, who they were, and what purpose
        they served. A practitioner of medicine, just like my aunt was.

    narrator """
        \"You've been in a coma for weeks. Do you remember who you are?\" Her
        voice resonated a gentle tone filled with kindness.

    narrator "In response, I nodded as she asked me my name."
    narrator "\"Do you remember what happened?\""
    narrator "There was a small pause between our conversation."
    narrator "Confused, I repeated her question. \"What happened?\""

        I saw the nurse evidently change her expression into a pensive sign, as
        if she were grieving.

    narrator """
        \"You had a terrible injury\". The doctor cut in stoically. \"Ah, don't
        worry about your payment. Your cafeteria manager and Ms. Emilia, your
        aunt, had both paid your medical bills. She used to be a director here.
        Do you know that?\"
    """

    narrator """
        \"Injury?\" Now that it came to my attention, my body felt heavy, almost
        as if I had an anchor atop of me. My head was so uncomfortable that it
        physically hurts to think much.
    """

    narrator """
        \"Yes, we were informed that you were an athlete before, am I right? A
        track-and-field star to be specific.\" The doctor rubbed his chin. I can
        feel his artificial concern gauging my reactions. \"Unfortunately, it is
        not advisable for you to place your lower body under great stress, at
        least until it reaches full recovery which will take multiple years or
        so.\"

    narrator """
        \"Oh.\", I stared at the bandages in front of me. They were my legs.

    narrator "The doctor and nurse stared at each other, as if in surprise."

    narrator """
        \"You survived a collision against a truck. However, it is almost
        unnatural, frankly, even the police wanted to know more. And then, it
        seems that you have symptoms of short-term memory loss. Do you really
        not remember what happened?\"

        \"Don't worry about it. You had a head injury as well. Nothing too
        serious but none would doubt even if you fake forgetting your whole
        biography.\" The doctor laughed stiffly. \"Well, I suppose that's it.
        Let us meet again in a few weeks, Mr. Lates.\"

    narrator """
        The two people in white walk out of the room after the conversation,
        almost in a hurry. They were whispering something. I can hear them, but
        their exchange doesn't make sense to me. Their faces showed worry, but
        not for me. Definitely not me.
