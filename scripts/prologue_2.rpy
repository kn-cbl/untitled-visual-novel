        The first thing that my nurse told me was that I had amnesia. Although I
        remember everything I could since I was a child, the night of the
        accident and why I was here are absent from my memory. It was almost too
        convenient.

        Days passed, and I thought about my life after all these medications. I
        won't be who I was anymore, but maybe I'll still live a normal life. I'm
        sure all of them would understand that I'm unable to run anymore just
        like I did, an athlete of my school. Once I healed up, I would wake up
        early, study hard, or maybe don't study at all, get friends, take care
        of myself, get a relationship with a very cute girlfriend, and do all
        those normal things that everyone thinks are worth living for.

    narrator """
        I was probably sneering. Life in the hospital was that boring. Most of
        my days, I lay here in bed with nothing but piles of complicated books.
        However, even if those daydreams were nothing but a silly joke, all
        those hopes completely shattered as soon as this guy in blue stepped
        inside the room. His visit was not because he's worried about my health,
        that's what I immediately assumed, but rather, it was for something
        dreadful that I probably don't want to hear.

        towards my face.
