Pretending to be normal was a waste of time. Even if I try my best to act as one, the world will pull me back to the place where I belong. In my solitude, I am most comfortable. An apathetic life, ruthlessly cold tactics and with strategic words that pierce stronger than my bullet. It’s my one of m
I’m a detective, not for the police or something private but for the local mafia which my aunt had some connection with. Cigarettes, rough vocabulary, mostly slang, laughters at the shittiest joke ranging from the funniest I’ve heard (it’s all nonsense), champagne, wine, beer, vodka, prostitution, women with bare clothes, naked even, whatever alcoholic drink atop the bar table, but then when it comes to business there are rats, there are those ambitious kind. Those who are cold-blooded that they don’t think twice about murder and betrayal, that’s the environment I grew up with. And when the boss tried to give me some adult entertainment, my aunt would’ve always instantly been behind him. Almost like teleporting, and beating the shit out of him, sometimes she just kicks the ass of everyone and leaves unscratched. She’s one hell of a scary aunt.
My lungs screamed as I caught my breath. I ran for twenty minutes straight from my workplace to Alice's house. The road was uphill, but my legs continued regardless.
“Your girlfriend sent you a letter.”

I’m done. 
That’s all the letter told me. My relationship with her was complicated, yet those words were enough to set my chest ablaze.
It was easier to take the bus, but my brain didn’t have any power to think so, and I think it was because I met her that the panic swallowed me.
I reached the front yard of her house. The entrance gate was ajar. My sweat continuously gushed, and my t-shirt drenched. Beyond the gate lies my anxiety. Their living room was entirely covered in darkness.
“Alice!” I cried so hard I felt my throat reverberate. 
In a rush, I tripped over and scraped my knees. It definitely bled, but still, I ran over to their door in desperation.

It was really dark. Anything inside was barely distinguishable. There was a silhouette. It noticed me. It dropped something, and that let out a metal clank.
“Alice!”
The silhouette ran away, straight from where the motorcycle was parked. My attention, however, was only focused on where she was.
That’s why...
I was reminded,
the moment that I saw her lifeless body,
Beautifully lying cold on the floor,
That on that day—
She prayed her wish by the falling star—
My sweet memory and a hopeful heart,
Moment’s bliss and a broken bridge.
The sudden storm and its gale of lies,
Like a stranger’s home in unwanted paradise.
All love confined, endured— a sadistic torture.
A heart discouraged, persisted and twisted.
Alice, I wonder, had you remember?
Prologue
Every single weekday, a normal student goes to school and studies for their own sake. They were the words of every single teacher I’ve met. It’s been six months since I left Track and Field. I used to be an athlete. They called me their ace until my ankle got injured in an accident. It was an unfortunate incident caused by my carelessness. During my stay in the hospital, I kept blaming myself. My memories, anxiety, and the helpless hurt that was stuck right inside my chest never healed, no matter how much time had passed.
I hated adults; to accept that there’s already a path made for us was insane. No matter how much effort I exerted, it felt like there was no hint of progress. All the doubt and regret cluttered, and every single day it was ready to burst. Which is why I can’t forgive myself. I hate my incompetence and detest every bit of myself.
This story was written to show the world how miserable I am. All I could do was put on a poker face and laugh at how exceptionally absurd it is. I could never erase the memories that bloom and haunt me. That’s why, someday, may a world where the knowledge that my soul willingly soaked in and accepted never turn completely useless… or something like that.

Prologue I
I thought of attending class. Every night, I work part-time at a coffee shop. I lied in my resume about how old I am, but as a barista, I’m apparently skilled enough. It was thanks to my aunt, who was a coffee nerd. She taught me a lot of priceless lessons in life.
It would be a lie if I said that I’m too exhausted to study. I guess I just don’t feel like it. My attendance has been poor. At some point, I’ll be a drop-out student due to my absences.

But because of my stubborn indifference towards the future, I had impulsively decided not to. “Whatever,” I yawned and stretched my body as I threw the cigarette that I was smoking.

In a clubroom, the room was the same as ever. The reader’s club was the club I ended up with after I quit the last one I joined. There were only a few of us. In fact, the members only met its minimum requirement. I, Eve, and the other man whose name I can’t recall—he barely attended our club activities—can't blame me for that, honestly.
After a few months of my injury, I was discharged from the hospital. I could walk just fine, but it was still difficult to run. I’m essentially a crippled person compared to who I was before.
In my leisure time, I was reading a book written by King. It was a horror novel. Apparently, this work was one of Eve’s favorites. I stayed here until the afternoon and read about a hundred pages.
I was never fond of horror. I suppose that I kept reading just because, and at the same time, I was bored out of my mind that there was nothing better to do. In all honesty, I had many problems with his style, but it was certainly an experience, to say the least. It was a fun read and well worth my time.
The time flowed, I barely noticed. I mean, I fell asleep and skipped class, but at this point, it didn’t mean anything to me. Simply because, one day, I couldn’t care less about my grades. I never got curious why, and although I have my own reasons, I would rather keep it to myself.
A clack of the door as the sound of the wood softly banged the wall beside the club entrance had distracted me from reading peacefully. There was a rude visitor.
“You’re cutting classes in our club room again? "The stranger intruded rudely, and as she sighed, I figured that something had disappointed her. Eve was her name. She’s one of my clubmates, the president even. She's never demanding or bossy despite the fact, but her moral standards were infectious. If anything, almost no one, not even the professors, won an argument against her.
“Your attendance has been so poor that our class advisor approached me to do something about it.”

I didn’t say anything. Every ounce of my focus was directed at the book I’m reading.

I could hear her footsteps. They were in an interval fast enough for me to sense something ominous. 

Before I knew it, she picked up the book that I was reading. I was surprised. Her pretty face and serious demeanor caught me unguarded.

“This isn’t a joke, you could’ve gotten expelled,” said Eve as she fixed her posture.

“There’s no reason for me to attend classes.” I calmly retorted. “I’m sorry but I don’t want to waste my time learning something useless.”

“That’s not true,” she argued confidently. “It’s not useless because education is essential.” 

“How? Are you telling me that you use trigonometry everyday? That’s stupid.”

“You’re stupid.”

“What do you even mean by that?”

“Even if you don't, some people will, like those who would take engineering at college.”

“But I will not, Eve. That’s the point. Algebra, research, and seriously, quantum physics?” Lazily, I shrugged my shoulders.

“You were not like this before…” 

“Yeah… I know.” 

The pause after was awkward. The atmosphere got heavier as the silence continued. Eve frowned. She seemed discouraged. I was unnecessarily rude when she showed concern. If anything, it was just right to apologize.

“I’m sorry, Eve…” I sighed, probably frowning. “That was too immature of me. I was starting to enjoy that book, by the way. May I borrow it?”

Eve submissively returned the book. The intensity and awkwardness calmed down between us. Although It felt like she wanted to say something, Eve evidently held back.

“Okay, but can you at least attend your class? Your grades wouldn’t matter if the professors decided to drop you out.”

“Alright,” I sighed dramatically.

Excitedly, Eve grabbed the chair beside me and sat. There was a total transformation from her mood. It was like night and day.

“So? How did you like the book so far?” asks Eve, her eyes glimmering from curiosity.

“It was tense. Characters are interesting, I enjoyed how the narration focused on the psychological aspect of the story.”

“I see…”

Everything turned to normal again after I gave her my opinion. It marked the end of our banter. The club room was filled with silence. Its floor was covered with a golden shine. The temperature was just right. It wasn’t too cold or too hot. Eve prepared tea and biscuits. This was her offer at the start of the semester: “To anyone who joins the reader’s club, you’ll get free tea and biscuits as long as you read during our time."
She brewed them perfectly, and the aroma that the tea had was soothing. The biscuits brand was unfamiliar to me. The language seemed French—a luxury. Every sweets and tea she offered were certainly delicious. It was such a shame that not a lot of students were interested, but at the same time I prefer it that way.
Most students normally go home after five, but I was still reading until the sun went down. This was common for me. There’s nothing to do after school other than wait for work. For Eve, I do think that if she could read in one place forever, without responsibilities awaiting her, she would. That’s my impression, at least, but regardless, she’s such a bookworm that I've never questioned her love for books.
Personally, it’s more fun to read with snacks and tea. Second, I don’t want to go home yet. A few hours of break doing nothing isn’t worth it unless I need to take a bath. I rather stay on the streets and buy myself some smoke.
“How are you lately?” 

“I’m alright.”

“I see.”

And with that, she dismissed the club for today. I placed the book on the bookshelf. She cleaned the tea cups, tea plates, and the plate on which the snacks had been placed. I helped her dry them by wiping them with a dishcloth.
The distance between Eve’s dorm and the school was ten minutes or less. Most students had a car or someone to fetch them, especially the rich ones. Some even used their bicycles because the school always promoted that eco-friendly vehicle, and I’m sure that there’s a huge fitness advantage to cycling daily.
Eve always preferred to walk. I do as well. I love to observe the town at night. There’s something about it that makes me feel homesick, and yet it's such a warm feeling that I don’t mind staying.
“Eve, do you mind if I walk with you?” 

She meekly nodded.

My aunt told me before that I should never let a girl walk alone at night, especially if I’m acquainted with her.

“But, don’t you have work to do?”


“It’s fine.” I answered. “My work is along that path.”


We reached the intersection between the road to her dorm, and to where I’m supposed to go. It was time for us to part and wave goodbye.

“Thank you for today.”

My life as an athlete was already over. Even though my legs got injured after the accident, the doctor said that they are fine enough to walk or jog as long as I don’t abuse my legs too harshly or place them under too much physical stress. Obviously, I can never be an athlete anymore. It’s true. I can feel it myself. These legs of mine don’t work like they used to. I have never tried running all-out again since then, even when I was confined at the hospital. The nurse stopped me from placing my body under too much physical stress. It’s not like I could because the stupid walking sticks were basically glued to me before.
I sighed. An extremely stupid idea just popped into my head almost impulsively. I stretched my legs, jerked my feet, and did twenty jumping jacks. It was a nice warm-up. I leaned my body down. I was bending, ready to run. In three. In two, and one...
…
Nothing.

It felt like the world had stopped. There’s nothing. Dizziness came over my head. I felt my heartbeat pulsating. I was sweating all over my body. I can’t move my hands. My body won't respond.
What? I didn’t even have time to be surprised. Why? It was so funny. Oh god. My world turned gray. Run. These legs are stuck. Run! Like a piece of meat rotten and rejected. Why don’t you run? I can’t breathe. I was shivering. My body won’t move. I’m possessed by a ghastly thread. These joints stuck like they’re erased.
“Ah!” Until suddenly, Eve came back. “Before you go, please wait!” 
She was panting. Maybe she remembered something important, as she was definitely in a rush.
“I’m glad you’re still here! "She smiled sweetly. “Please,” she said, almost shouting dramatically while her index finger pointed right at me. "Don't forget to attend your classes tomorrow! ”
I blanked out.  
“I will try," stuttering in both amazement and surprise.

“That’s not a good enough answer!”
"Yeah." For some reason, I found her soft, ladylike voice heartwarming. “I’ll do my best.”

And with that, Eve smiled as she gracefully turned her back straight to the dormitory.
Prologue II
Off-tone notes, piano licks, and suave plucking of guitar chords—through the speaker of high audio definition, the jazz soundtrack was continuously played inside the coffee shop I work with. My outfit as a barista was in a considerable amount of exquisite fashion: a black and white apron, slacks and belt, a white polo, and black shoes. The manager and I had the same outfit until our shift, which was specifically between seven to twelve. The amount of salary they offered was manageable, but the real reason I applied here was because I like coffee. Although I always felt like there was a real reason why, the thought never fully entered my mind.
Anyway, Coffee Mania was not as popular as Stabsucks; that’s why the workload was lax. The familiar customers had always ordered the same meals. That lady with glasses and a high-end laptop likes to buy chocolate cake and strawberry frappes, and the man with her iPad loves to order low-calorie beverages just like Cafe Americano. I get it. That drink barely had calories in it—a healthy coffee in exchange for its awful taste.
Most of them were polite and friendly people who were easy to talk to. It was the same as for my co-workers, Erika and the manager. Despite the age gap, in which I doubt it’s clear to them how much, they never act too strict.
“May I buy a Latte please?”

“Right away.”


“You look like you’re too young to work… or maybe you’re just a handsome boy.”

“Thank you, ma’am.” 

At times like this, I don’t know exactly how to respond with these types of conversation. I just go with the flow, the best I can, with an intention to fully hide my age of course.

“What’s your name?”

“Uh…”

“Do you have a girlfriend?”

Pain.

“No, not really…”

“No way, I was sure you had a lot!”

Players have too much emotional strength, how they could juggle between each other was beyond me.

“I wish my son was half as studious as you. He only locks himself inside his room, never studying, failing exams… Sighs.”

I gave her her coffee latte, and after that, she left and returned to her table as she minded her own business.
There was a reason why I got myself a job. It was a very selfish one. In fact, I don’t necessarily need to tire myself out like this. My aunt gives me money monthly to buy groceries and the things that I want. She also pays for my tuition.
Each time I reflect on myself in this case, the conclusion always arrives that there's no good reason why I should continue my shift for Coffee Mania. I didn’t even tell her that I’m working, and it's not like she suspected anything for now, but a good chance was that she already knew.
“Hey, just got here!” A familiar co-worker appeared, her name is Erika, a college student. “Wah! You’re early again! Makes me think that I’m late.”
“You should try and do the same once in a while, Erika,” cuts the manager as he pats my head, “this kid right here displays an ideal work ethic for the employees. It’s just right for everyone to show the same motivation.”
“Jeez, boss. That’s not fair.”
I’m not a kid you know. “If anything, maybe you should work instead of napping at the customer's table just a few minutes ago.”

“Woah.”

“That’s the kid for you,” grins Erika as she was staring at the manager, and laughed back at me.
“You copped me out man…” The manager sulked. “But we don’t have many customers, and at this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if Coffee Mania closed down.”
Should the manager talk that way?
“Well, I’m sure it’ll all be fine,” Erika replied with her passive optimism as she tended her hair. “Our job is to do our job, right?”
“Right.”
“By the way, do any of you know the stories that've been circling around lately?” 
Erika and I both shaked our heads.
“Story, you say? What is it, like some urban legends?”

“Yeah, exactly.”

“We’re too old to believe in that stuff…”
“Well, just listen. Apparently, one of the college students was dating in the park at night. I mean, it’s pretty normal during my days but there’s something in this story that was exceptionally unique.”

“Can’t say about me, but I’m sure one of my friends does that as well. That’s pretty much some daily stuff for them normies.” 
I sometimes wonder if college students only think about dating. “So, what’s the catch, manager?”
“Well, he told everyone that he saw the grim reaper. Can’t see the face since the dude was apparently wearing some edgy dark cloak, like you know, the cartoon depiction of their kind. No one really believed him, I mean, would you? I’m sure anyone would agree, there’s a weirdo cosplaying as a grim reaper, and that’s it. But here’s the weird part, the grim reaper told him that his time is up, naturally, he laughed like hell. He told the grim reaper that he had too much to drink, or smoke, whatever. The college dude even told her gf but she didn’t take him seriously, and well, so did he. I mean that’s how the story revolved.”

“Ah, I heard that story too! "Interrupts Erika, “my friend mentioned it once, but no one really takes that story seriously. Oh, and also, apparently, the same person went missing for days now. It really makes you wonder."
“Well, the truth is, I know what happened to him.”

I gulped.

“Oh?” The manager smirked playfully as he turned his mocking gaze right at me. “I didn’t know that the kid was so  easily scared.”

“I’m not.”
“Don’t bully him. I’m sure that everyone has some weak point or another!”

But, really, to see a glimpse of the grim reaper itself huh? That story itself is quite childish.
“Anyway, there’s a customer. Time to work, boys and girls.”
“Right!” Erika and I answered synchronously.
Anyway, there’s really not much of a customer tonight. I guess that’s just expected. What should I do?

“Yo, do you want to take a break?”

“Yeah, I guess.”

“Honestly, looking at you I would suggest that you atleast take one to three days of leave.”

The manager was surprisingly worried about me, “Was it because we haven’t got many customers lately?”

“The self-awareness of this one,” he let out such a disappointing sigh with a pensive face.


“Wait manager! I wanted to talk to you about the grim reaper stuff earlier.”

“About that? Just move on, this type of story isn’t for you.”

Because it was horror?

“You’ll be surprised, I watched even the scariest film ever made by Mr. Friedkin or Kim Jee-won.”
William Friedkin. As far as I’ve watched, there are two films that I’ve seen, and I’m confident enough that they were universally hailed as masterpieces. 12 Angry Men and The Exorcist and if I had to take a pick, 12 Angry Men has got to be one of my favorites, not just as a film but also as a means to reflect my ideals to society and what it takes for other people to absorb my values and virtues. I’m not saying that I’m a saint; every man has a finite life, and that film made me realize that it takes so much effort to try and persuade a human heart. Justice, law, empathy, and truth—every other brain has its own particular take and level of apathy for strangers. It’s really easier if one just doesn't care, regardless of the stakes.
“Well, no, it’s not about that at all.”

Kim Jee-Won. I Saw The Devil was recommended to me by a friend on the internet, and it turned out to be one of my favorite horror-psychological thrillers ever. The gory aesthetic and angst of this film resonate with me. I could just gush about Choi Min-sik’s fanboy for like forever. His work with Oldboy was just as beautiful. However, don’t be tempted by the words I chose, because that and A Tale of Two Sisters were two of the films that actually scared the shit out of me. Please watch it! It’s kino af.

“You see, the guy got himself into trouble, cheated on the daughter of a mafia boss.”
“Oh.” I replied, speechless. Yikes. Now my expectations were ruined, and yeah, it’s interesting, but at the same time, it’s none of my business. He’s right. I don’t want to hear anything anymore, I guess. It’s still interesting though.
Choices - Talk to Erika

The truth was, I was never the boy who approached Erika to converse. Normally, she would’ve just surprised me, and that’s how the flow would go. Sometimes, she just catches me glancing at her, and that’s how we will be talking. She might look a bit serious at work, but the impression I got from her was that she’s a bubbly person.


“How's it going?”	
“The work? It’s fine, helps that it isn’t busy.”

“I mean, no. Nevermind.”

Erika seems to have a problem. She was fidgeting as if unsure of what she was about to do.

“Manager! Can we take a smoke break?!”


We?

“Sure.”

Wait what? I didn’t consent to this! 
With the sound of the lighter flickering, the slim cigarette femininely hangs at the tip of Erika’s fingernails. Her red lips are attached to the brown end of a slim cigarette as she sucks the tip and simultaneously lights the tobacco. 
The smoke started to puff out from her mouth and nose. Her beautiful chin relaxed, and her back leaned against the brick wall.
“Want some?”

“Sure.”

“You know, something was bothering me. I felt like I’ve seen you before.”

“Me?”

“And you look too young to work too, hell, smoking cigarettes even.”

“I get that alot.”

“But I mean, that’s not really my business. Do you know that I started working when I was fifteen? It’s not like my family can’t pay for me or anything, I just wanted to buy something using my own money. Clothes, shoes, make-up, all that stuff.”
My reason for working…

“And perhaps you haven’t noticed yourself, I also know when a man has a bit of a lapse under his sleep.”


I did the same, but not as cool as her. I lit the cigarette and started smoking it. Her cig was menthol, the same brand and flavor as the one I always buy.

“Then again, I don’t really know much about you but I’m worried. You can tell your big sis your problems anytime, you know?”


“I don’t know…”

“Hm…?”


It’s strange. Between my work and my school and my friends, there was something different. 

“How’s your school?”

“It sucks,” I sigh, gazing away from her.


Erika smoked and puffed the nicotine that she inhaled right through her lungs.

“I don’t know why. I used to be someone who could study easily, get to the honors easily, but now, it sucks. It’s boring. Everyone, my classmates, except Eve, I guess. She’s nice, pretty too.”

“Eve’s your girlfriend?”

“No!” I blushed. “We’re nothing like that. I mean, I already had one anyway.”

For some reason, my heart starts to swell. I want to run away from this conversation.

Erika was silent as well. This was awkward.

“You look like you're in pain.”

“I don’t know.” I bit my lips to stop the tears. “Right now, if I could tell you, I don’t know if it’s right or wrong just to say so but, I enjoy being with you, being with manager and serving customers, way more than the kids my age. Isn’t that weird? I’m a weirdo. It’s abnormal.”

“That’s not true.”

“Anyway, I’m sorry for bothering you with all these.” but before I had a chance to step away, I felt a soft touch on my hand. It was Erika. She patted my head, and then placed it above her chest.

“Do you feel like crying?”

“No, not really.”

“Big sis is not enough… I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize. In the first place, I’m just a stranger, and you’re like an angel.” I said that. I really said that.

“Ah…” 

I’m embarrassed. Such corny words, but now I can’t take it back. She’ll probably laugh at me later on. I’m sorry.

Black Screen

Back at the Cafe

“Yo, kid, welcome back. How is it? Is Erika your girlfriend now?”

Shivers.

“What the fuck, manager.”


Blood boiling.

“Oi. Oi. That’s no way to talk to your manager Mr. Playboy.”

The fuck is your problem?

Erika clinged to my shoulder flirtatiously. “Got a problem with that?” And she sweetly stared at me with the amount of body contact only couples do as if to say, “am I right?”

Shut up.

“No way,” the manager’s mouth agape in pure amazement, almost sarcastically.

“I’m sorry!” 

And then…

I ran away,

Like there’s a jet engine attached to my legs. 

“Jeez, Erika, you’re cruel.”

“Wait what? What do you mean? I just got rejected! I mean, I’m not that serious, but,” however, the manager cuts Erika before she could finish her sentence.
“Months ago, someone gave that kid a letter. I don’t know what it said, but the moment he opened the letter, his face turned completely pale, horrified.”
“I remember, but I was absent that day."

“And on the same day, he was hospitalized. Up until now, I never really asked what happened, but at the same time, I don’t think that it's your fault per se. Let's face it, the kid has problems, and it's too much of us if he expects us to give him special treatment; actually, nevermind, but that’s my take as your manager.”



Back at the Cafe.
I was running vigorously, like I used to. It’s been over ten minutes, but my legs refused to stop. I was trembling, scared, and afraid. My lungs pumped oxygen; I felt it. I was less sturdier, and my stamina had been affected, most likely due to smoking cigarettes, but I don’t care.
Before I knew it, I was in the park. It was unbelievably foggy. What time is it? I checked my smartphone. It was eleven at night. There aren't many people here. In fact, it’s just me alone in the middle of the night. The streetlights, the garden, small trees, and benches—this is the park that I’ve known. This place used to be a popular spot for grown-ups, but now it’s only me that’s here.
The grim reaper, yeah. Such a childish story that no one would ever believe, nor even try to take seriously.
I’m exhausted. I think my legs gave up. It was understandable. I forced them to run like that. If anything, I’m glad I didn’t get into another accident while on some sort of childish rampage. This never happened before, and my heart was blazing. My whole body was in heat, and it’s slowly cooling down.
I’m disappointed in myself. I destroyed it—the effort that I obsessively and continuously gave half of my life—just because I wanted to smoke (but I can’t help it). 
Maybe inside of me, I've already faced it. I don’t think I’ll be like them at all. Having a normal family, no matter what hardships, having normal friends, and having normal hobbies—none of them described what I really am inside. I’m what people around the school describe as truant, a loser, and a disappointment. Someone who’s washed up and someone who failed everybody’s expectations—a stubborn piece of meat that doesn't know its place in the world.
I cried. I think I’m tearing up. My posture curved like a shrimp, almost kneeling to the ground. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't.

The last thing I remembered before my knee broke was a beep and a blinding headlight. After that—my stomach raged like crazy. The world around me, I was dizzy. Blood rushed to my head. It was really cold. The park was too foggy, and dark, as if I’m trapped inside the park.

I caught my breath, stabilized. 

No more memories. Please brain. No more, I don’t want it.


And that’s how it happened, the meeting between the impossible.

“Are you alright?”

It was sweet, a voice very familiar to me echoed inside my ears like honey.

“Alice?’

She is wearing a dark cloak.

“No, I’m not Alice.” 


And just like that, her body was glittering gold, ethereally fading away.

“Wait!” Abruptly, I grabbed her hand. “Don’t leave me.”

She didn’t say anything, other than…

“It was nice meeting you again.”
