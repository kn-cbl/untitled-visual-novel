My lungs screamed as I caught my breath. I ran for twenty minutes straight from my workplace to Alice's house. The road was uphill, but my legs continued regardless.
“Your girlfriend sent you a letter.”

I’m done. 
That’s all the letter told me.
It was easier to take the bus, but my brain didn’t have any power to think so, and I think it was because I met her that the panic easily overcame my fragile rationality.
I reached the front yard of her house. The entrance gate was ajar. My sweat continuously gushed, and my t-shirt drenched. Beyond the gate lies my anxiety. Their living room was covered in darkness.
“Alice!” I cried so hard I felt my throat reverberate. 
In a rush, I tripped over and scraped my knees. It definitely bled, but still, I ran over to their door in desperation.

 It was really dark. Anything inside was barely distinguishable. There was a silhouette. It noticed me. It dropped something, and that let out a metal clank.
(See? I know everything. I fucking knew it!)
“Alice!”
The silhouette ran away, straight from where the motorcycle was parked. My attention, however, was only focused on where she was.
That’s why… I was reminded, the moment I saw her, that—
She prayed her wish by the falling star—
My sweet memory and a hopeful heart,
Moment’s bliss and a broken bridge.
The sudden storm and its gale of lies,
Like a stranger’s home in unwanted paradise.
All love confined, endured— a sadistic torture.
A heart discouraged, persisted and twisted.
Alice, I wonder, had you remember?

Prologue
Every single weekday, a normal student goes to school and studies for their own sake. They were the words of every single teacher I’ve met. It’s been six months since I left Track and Field. I used to be an athlete. They called me their ace until my ankle got injured in an accident. It was an unfortunate incident caused by my carelessness. During my stay in the hospital, I kept blaming myself. My memories, anxiety, and the helpless hurt that was stuck right inside my chest never healed, no matter how much time had passed.
I hated adults; to accept that there’s already a path made for us was insane. No matter how much effort I exerted, it felt like there was no hint of progress. All the doubt and regret cluttered, and every single day it was ready to burst. Which is why I can’t forgive myself. I hate my incompetence and detest every bit of myself.
This story was written to show the world how miserable I am. All I could do was put on a poker face and laugh at how exceptionally absurd it is. I could never erase the memories that bloom and haunt me. That’s why, someday, may a world where the knowledge that my soul willingly soaked in and accepted never turn completely useless… or something like that.

Prologue I
I thought of attending class. Every night, I work part-time at a coffee shop. I lied in my resume about how old I am, but as a barista, I’m apparently skilled enough. It was thanks to my aunt, who was a coffee nerd. She used to teach me a lot of things.
It would be a lie if I said that I’m too exhausted to study. I guess I just don’t feel like it. My attendance has been poor. At some point, I’ll be a drop-out.

“Whatever,” I sighed as I threw the cigarette that I was smoking.

In a clubroom, the room was the same as ever. The reader’s club was the club I ended up with after I quit the last one I joined. There were only a few of us. In fact, the members only met its minimum requirement. I, Eve, and the other man whose name I can’t recall—he barely attended our club activities—can't blame me for that, honestly.
After a few months of my injury, I was discharged from the hospital. I could walk just fine, but it was still difficult to run. I’m essentially a crippled person compared to who I was before.
In my leisure time, I was reading a book written by King. It was a horror novel. Apparently, this work was one of Eve’s favorites. I stayed here until the afternoon and read about a hundred pages.
I was never fond of horror. I suppose that I kept reading just because, and at the same time, I was bored out of my mind that there was nothing better to do. In all honesty, I had many problems with his style, but it was certainly an experience, to say the least. It was a fun read and well worth my time.
The time flowed, I barely noticed. I mean, I fell asleep and skipped class, but at this point, it didn’t mean anything to me. Simply because, one day, I couldn’t care less about my grades. I never got curious why, and although I have my own reasons, I would rather keep it to myself.
A clack of the door as the sound of the wood softly banged the wall beside the club entrance had distracted me from reading peacefully. There was a rude visitor.
“You’re in the club room again? "The stranger intruded rudely, and as she sighed so hard, I easily felt how disappointed she was. No, not exactly a stranger. Her name is Eve. She is one of my clubmates.
“Your attendance has been so poor that our class advisor approached me to do something about it.”

I didn’t say anything. Every ounce of my focus was directed at the book I’m reading.

I could hear her footsteps. They were in an interval fast enough for me to sense something ominous. 

Before I knew it, she picked up the book that I was reading. I was surprised. Her pretty face and serious demeanor caught me unguarded.

“This isn’t a joke, you could’ve gotten expelled,” said Eve as she fixed her posture.

“There’s no reason for me to attend classes.” I calmly retorted. “I’m sorry but I don’t want to waste my time learning something useless.”

“That’s not true,” she argued confidently. “It’s not useless because education is essential.” 

“How? Are you telling me that you use trigonometry every single day? That’s stupid.”

“You’re stupid.”

“What do you even mean by that?”

“Even if you don't, some people will, like those who would take engineering at college.”

“But I will not, Eve. That’s the point. Algebra, research, and seriously, quantum physics?” Lazily, I shrugged my shoulders.

“You were not like this before…” 

“Yeah… I know.” 

The pause after was awkward. The atmosphere got heavier as the silence continued. Eve frowned. She seemed discouraged. I was unnecessarily rude when she showed concern. If anything, it was just right to apologize.

“I’m sorry, Eve…” I sighed, probably frowning. “That was too immature of me. I was starting to enjoy that book, by the way. May I borrow it?”

Eve submissively returned the book. The intensity and awkwardness calmed down between us. Although It felt like she wanted to say something, Eve evidently held back.

“Okay, but can you at least attend your class? Your grades wouldn’t matter if the professors decided to drop you out.”

“Alright,” I sighed dramatically.

Excitedly, Eve grabbed the chair beside me and sat. There was a total transformation from her mood. It was like night and day.

“So? How did you like The Shining so far?” asks Eve, her eyes glimmering from curiosity.

“It was tense. Characters are interesting, I enjoyed how the narration focused on the psychological aspect of the story.”

“I see…”

Everything turned to normal again after I gave her my opinion. It marked the end of our banter. The club room was filled with silence. Its floor was covered with a golden shine. The temperature was just right. It wasn’t too cold or too hot. Eve prepared tea and biscuits. This was her offer at the start of the semester: “To anyone who joins the reader’s club, you’ll get free tea and biscuits as long as you read during our time."
She brewed them perfectly, and the aroma that the tea had was soothing. The biscuits brand was unfamiliar to me. The language seemed French-a luxury. Every sweets and tea she offered were certainly delicious.
The students normally went home after five, but our club, me and Eve, were immersed until six.
